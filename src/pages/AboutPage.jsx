             <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">My journey</h2>
             <p>From a young age, I've been captivated by technology. My fascination began with an old laptop
                and evolved into a deep passion for computers. It was at university, where I earned my first-class engineering degree,
                that I wrote my first lines of code. After completing a final year project writing a <em>*cough*</em> MATLAB <em>*cough*</em> program, I decided 
                to pursue coding full-time.

             <p>
             Outside of coding, I'm known for being straightforward and honest. I believe in the importance of clear communication and transparency,
             which helps foster trust and avoid miscommunication within any team. Whether leading a team or tackling a complex issue, this mindset
             is at the centre of my approach.
             <br /><br />
             Curiosity drives me to keep learning and exploring new things, whether tech-related or personal interests. This continuous quest for knowledge ensures that I stay ahead of the curve,
             always ready to integrate the latest advancements into my work.
             <br /><br />
             In essence, <strong>I'm a tech enthusiast with a multifaceted skill set</strong>, committed to making a meaningful impact in the digital world.
