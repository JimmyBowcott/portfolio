             <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">My journey</h2>
             <p>From a young age, I have always loved technology. My fascination began with an old laptop
                and my interest only grew from there. It was at university, where I earned my first-class engineering degree,
                that I wrote my first lines of code. After completing a final year project writing a <em>*cough*</em> MATLAB <em>*cough*</em> program, I decided 
                to pursue coding full-time.
